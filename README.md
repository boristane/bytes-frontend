byte: a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. The byte [...] is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)].

This is thus a collection of (in)frequent byte-sized posts on software development, architecture and whatever else I feel like writing.
